# Bad ping, but good nslookup. 
# For this to work, these should be in your /etc/hosts
# assuming nothing on your network would respond to a ping on 10.0.2.254, 
# add to your /etc/hosts (without comments, of course):
# 10.0.2.254 downhost1.blah.home.arpa
# 10.0.2.254 downhost2.blah.home.arpa
# 10.0.2.254 downhost3.blah.home.arpa
downhost1.blah.home.arpa
downhost2.blah.home.arpa
downhost3.blah.home.arpa
